# Moving and resizing a video during a presentation

Status: proposed.

## Goal

Let a video change position and size across presentation steps, the way
any other shape does — and, in doing so, replace the workaround that
made videos a special case in the first place. Playback stays smooth
across the move: the same player keeps playing, at the same position in
the video, while its frame travels.

A video _shape_ does not need to be a player. That relaxation is what
makes the rest of this design possible, and it is the one thing the
reader should carry into every section below. Editing keeps a live,
interactive player — just one per video, owned by the runtime rather
than by any shape.

## Why the current shape of the feature exists

The v2 animation model expresses "this shape is here at step 2, and
there at step 5" by carrying each keyframe on a **copy** of the shape.
Navigation switches which copy is visible, and a temporary clone tweens
between them.

For a video that mechanism is unusable: a copy is a second
`youtube-embed`, and a mounted `youtube-embed` is a live iframe. Two
copies means two players competing for the same video, and switching
visibility between them at a step boundary would restart playback
exactly when it should continue.

Everything that currently makes videos special descends from that one
fact — the `media-control` marker shape (a frame carrier that is _not_
a copy of the video), the `media-control` binding that ties it back,
the withheld follow-up-frame buttons, and the video's exemption from
the latest-frame-of-batch visibility rule.

## The idea

**Stop mounting a player per shape.** Video shapes render a static
poster; exactly one live player exists per video, owned by the runtime,
positioned to follow whichever shape currently represents that video —
in presentation mode and while editing alike.

Once a video shape is no longer a player, a copy of it is harmless, and
the special case collapses:

- Keyframes become **ordinary copies**, like every other animated
  shape. Drag & drop, the follow-up-frame buttons, duplicate-remap and
  paste all apply unchanged, with no new authoring UI to build.
- The player never remounts, because it is never owned by a shape that
  can be hidden, replaced or re-created. The class of bug that produced
  the reconnect and re-render remounts cannot recur here.
- The video's exemption from the visibility rule goes away: with real
  copies on the track, the latest-frame-of-batch rule is correct again.

### Where the player lives

`components.OnTheCanvas` renders inside `tl-html-layer tl-shapes`, the
element that carries the camera transform (`InFrontOfTheCanvas` is
outside it). A player placed there is positioned in page coordinates
and inherits pan, zoom and `cameraZoom` animation for free — the same
way a shape does, and without the store learning anything about it.

That last point is the reason not to animate the video shape directly.
Writing `x`/`y`/`w`/`h` during playback would put presentation state
into the document: on a synced deck every intermediate frame broadcasts
to collaborators, an interrupted presentation leaves the video
displaced, and `bailToMark` — which is how the current animation code
suppresses history — would fight the animation. Runtime state belongs
where the desired playback state already lives: outside the document.

### What the runtime tracks

Per video, the runtime already holds a desired **playback** state
(playing/paused, muted, volume) folded from the event history. This
adds a desired **transform**, folded the same way from the keyframe
history:

- Advancing one step tweens the transform over the frame's `duration`
  with its `easing`, alongside the existing animation.
- A jump or a backward move reconciles it directly to the folded value,
  with no tween — the same rule `foldMediaPlaybackStates` follows, for
  the same reason.
- Leaving presentation mode clears it, like `pauseAll`.

## Identity: `videoKey`

A moving video is several shapes. Something has to say "these carriers
are one video", and media events have to name the video they act on.

`trackId` is the wrong answer. A track says _which animation sequence_
a keyframe belongs to; a video that is visible from the start and only
receives media events has no animation at all, and so no track, while
still being a perfectly valid subject for `play` and `pause`.

So the video carries its own identity: a **`videoKey` prop**, minted
when the video is placed.

- **`videoKey`** — which video instance this is. Keys the live player,
  and is what a media event targets.
- **`trackId`** — which animation sequence a keyframe belongs to.
  Present only when the video is animated.

Carriers of one video share both. An unframed video has a `videoKey`
and no track. The two questions stop being entangled.

The duplicate-vs-rejoin distinction comes for free: the
follow-up-keyframe path is ours and preserves `videoKey`, while
`Cmd+D` and paste run through the remap wrapper, which mints a fresh
one alongside the fresh `trackId`. Duplicating a video therefore yields
an independent video with its own player, which is what the gesture
implies.

For existing documents the prop reads as `props.videoKey || shape.id`.
A props migration must be deterministic, so it cannot mint keys; the
fallback identifies each existing video as itself, which is correct
because today every video is exactly one shape.

## What this removes

Media events no longer need a record pointing at a shape. The binding
existed because tldraw remaps binding endpoints on copy/paste while a
shape id in props would go stale — but a `videoKey` in the frame's
action is remapped by the same operation-scoped machinery that already
handles `trackId`, so the guarantee survives without the record.

It also stops being _correct_ to bind to a shape: with several
carriers, a binding to keyframe #1 would cascade-delete a video's
events when that one keyframe is deleted.

Removed: the `media-control` binding's `BindingUtil`,
`bindMediaControlMarker`, `copyMediaControlBinding`,
`getMediaControlBindingTargetId`, and the marker parking hooks. The
binding type's schema registration stays — inert, never written again
— so that documents already holding the binding still validate long
enough to be migrated; the Rollout section says how.

Kept: the `media-control` marker shape. One frame per shape is still
the rule, so a media event still needs a carrier that is not the video.
`expandShapeIdsWithMediaControlMarkers` also stays, re-keyed to
`videoKey`, because copying a video should still bring its events along
and rewrite them to the copy's key.

### Delete and parking, without the binding

**Delete.** When the last carrier of a `videoKey` is removed, its event
markers are removed with it. Deleting one keyframe of an animated video
leaves the events alone — which the binding's per-shape cascade would
have got wrong.

**Parking.** Markers are invisible and zero-size, but they still count
toward `getCurrentPageBounds`, so a marker left behind by a moved video
skews `zoomToFit`. A side-effect handler on carrier movement keeps a
video's markers at its position. The cheaper alternative — park once at
creation and accept drift — is rejected: the drift is unbounded in the
one case users notice, which is moving a video far across the canvas.

## Editing

Video shapes render a static poster
(`i.ytimg.com/vi/<id>/hqdefault.jpg`), and the runtime anchors the one
live player to a single carrier of each `videoKey` — so a video is
still playable and interactive while editing, and the other keyframes
show where it will travel to. Nothing about a shape mounts a player, so
copies cost nothing.

Authoring a movement keyframe is then the same gesture as for any other
shape: extend the sequence from the timeline's follow-up-frame button,
then move or resize the new copy. No ghost outline, no bespoke
transform editor, no second kind of marker — the reason those were on
the table was that copies were forbidden.

`canExtendFrameSequenceFrom` drops its carrier-type exclusion for
videos; it keeps the action-type exclusion, since media events are
still added with "+ Media event" and chained by dragging.

## Alternatives considered

**Keyframe target on the marker's transform.** Markers carrying a
`shapeAnimation` frame become visible as a draggable ghost of the
video, and their transform is the target. Good authoring ergonomics
without touching the player architecture, but it needs the `w`/`h`
props back, makes parking and visibility conditional on the frame's
action type, and keeps every video a live player — so the remount
hazard and the withheld buttons stay. It buys movement without
simplifying anything.

**Keyframe target in the action's metadata.** Markers stay uniformly
invisible and no props change, but nothing on canvas represents the
target, so it needs a purpose-built overlay with its own drag and
resize handles: the most new UI of the three, reimplementing what
tldraw already gives a copy.

Both were shaped by the constraint that a copy of a video is
impossible. Removing that constraint is what makes them unnecessary.

**Mounting the player on one carrier shape.** Keeps live editing
without an overlay, by designating a single carrier as the host. Two
things break it. Culling is computed from a shape's own store bounds
and sets `display: none` on its container, so a player visually
displaced onto the screen is hidden whenever its host's home position
leaves the viewport. And re-anchoring — at a step boundary, when the
host is hidden by the visibility rule, or when it is deleted — moves
the iframe between DOM parents, which reloads it. Runtime ownership
avoids both while giving the same live editing.

**Multiple frames per shape.** Would remove the marker entirely, but
one-frame-per-shape is load-bearing across the derivation, the timeline
UI and reconciliation. Rejected for the same reason the media-event
array was rejected earlier: it trades one record type for a rewrite of
everything that reads frames.

## Rollout

The persisted vocabulary changes: the `mediaControl` action gains its
target key, `youtube-embed` gains `videoKey`, and the `media-control`
binding stops being written. `SYNC_CLIENT_VERSION` moves to 4, and old
clients are refused as usual.

Documents that already hold the binding are migrated on load, not
stranded. The version gate only refuses old *clients*; it does nothing
for the binding records that existing documents contain, and those
documents surface in more places than the sole-user framing suggests —
synced rooms, snapshot files, clipboard payloads, locally cached
copies. All of them arrive through tldraw's schema migration path, so
that is where the rewrite lives:

- The binding type stays registered (see above), so the old records
  load instead of failing validation.
- A store-level migration resolves, for each `media-control` binding,
  the video shape at its `toId`, and writes that shape's id into the
  `mediaControl` action carried by the marker at its `fromId`. Under
  the fallback rule above that id _is_ the video's `videoKey`, so the
  event keeps its target. Then the binding record is deleted.
- The migration reads only what is in the store, so it is
  deterministic, as store migrations must be.

A fixture document captured from the pre-migration schema, containing
a video with `media-control` bindings, pins the behavior: it must load
under the new schema with its event targeting intact.

The schema registration and the migration are the whole compatibility
surface; everything behavioral is deleted now. Dropping those two is
possible once no unmigrated document remains, and is a later judgment
call, not a step in this rollout.
