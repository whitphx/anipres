Let a video move and resize across presentation steps.

A video shape no longer mounts a player. Shapes render a poster and the runtime owns exactly one live player per video, positioned to follow whichever carrier currently represents it, so a copy of a video is harmless and its keyframes become ordinary copies — the follow-up-frame buttons, drag & drop, duplicate-remap and paste all apply to videos unchanged. Videos also stop being exempt from the latest-frame-of-batch visibility rule.

Carriers of one video are tied together by a new `videoKey` prop rather than by the `media-control` binding, which a media event now names directly; existing documents are normalized on load.
