When writing web frontend code (HTML, JSX, CSS, etc.), always consider accessibility (a11y):

- Use semantic HTML elements (e.g., `<button>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`) over generic `<div>`/`<span>` where appropriate
- Add `aria-label` to icon-only or visually ambiguous buttons/controls
- Use `aria-pressed` for toggle buttons to expose state to assistive tech
- Always set `type="button"` on `<button>` elements that are not form submit buttons
- Don't rely on `:hover` alone for revealing interactive elements — ensure they are accessible via keyboard (`:focus-visible`, `:focus-within`) and visible on touch devices (`@media (hover: hover)`)
- Ensure form inputs have associated labels
